# TV-Program
A repository for a TV Program, split into two python codes. The first program, called "TVProgram.py", which contains the "TV" Class, contains all the base methods of the TV, such as turning the TV on and off, increasing and decreasing both the TV Channel and Volume, and as well as setting and getting the values of the Channel and Volume. The second program, called "TestTV", which contains the "TestTv" Class, calls upon two objects from class TV; tv1 & tv2. This program asks the user for input and displays the texts; "tv1's channel is _____ and volume level is _______", "tv2's channel is _____ and volume level is _______", where the channel and volume values depend on the user's input. These texts are then displayed on a window screen with rainbow text.
